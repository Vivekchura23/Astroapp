Integrated Timer: A visible, accurate timer for all video, chat, and phone calls. Default consultation time duration of 30 minutes will be automatically set for chat, video call, and phone call, but this default can be edited manually by me from the admin dashboard for each booking or as a global setting. The timer will allow me to manage consultation duration, and automatically calculate session charges. Give an alert for both side (student/client and astrologer ) 5 minutes before the consultation ends. Try to display timer count on both end ( for video call, phone call, chat during live consultation ). Try to keep an option- client can add anyone ( single or multi persons upto 4 ) during live consultation ( video call, phone call, and chat ). Live chat consultation should have features of sending text , image ,video, voice of good quality from both side ). 
Pre-consultation Setup: Ability for me to quickly pull up the client's profile, manually uploaded charts ( image/pdf file ) by clients  and hand typed notes before starting a call.
